Shepora, Yves Rocher, Mary Kay, Natura and Unilever are some of the brands that will have a "made in Guanajuato" seal, with the production kick-off at Cosmeco. Located in the municipality of  San Jose Iturbide, Fareva Group, a French-origin firm, will open its second plant in Mexico, to manufacture cosmetic products such as compact powders, lipsticks, lash mascaras, as well as personal care products such as body lotions, shampoos, shower gels and mouthwash. This group has annual products sales worth over US$1.5 [1] billion in total, considering its 35 plants distributed in 11 countries: France, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Russia, United States, Brazil, Turkey, Poland and Ukraine. This second investment in Mexico by the Group is ten times the investment made for their previous plant in the State of Mexico.
